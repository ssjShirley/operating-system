Introduction

----------------------

A SFS is a simple system which includes diskinfo, disklist, diskget, and diskput. Through these programs, you can display the information about the file system, display the contents of the root directory, copy a file from the file system to the current directory, and copy a file from the current directory into specified directory.



Requirements

-----------------------

[1]To use SFS, you need to type "make" to compile it first. After that you can run the programs.
 
[2]To run diskoinfo, execute './diskinfo <file system image>' from the terminal.

[3]To run disklist, execute './disklist <file system image>' from the terminal.

[4]To run diskget, execute './diskget <file system image> <file>' from the terminal.

[5]To run diskput, execute './diskput <file system image> <file>' from the terminal. 



Troubleshooting

-----------------------

This program diskget and diskput could not get into the subdirectory. It is still a problem.
